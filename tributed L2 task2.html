            <h2 class="title-section">About Albert Einstein</h2>
            <p>
                ☛ Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, on March 14, 1879. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).
                <br><br>
                ☛ His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect," a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
                <br><br>
                ☛ In 1905, which is often called his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), he published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined his special theory of relativity, explained the photoelectric effect, introduced the concept of Brownian motion, and explained the equivalence of mass and energy.
                <br><br>
                ☛ In 1915, he published the general theory of relativity, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. This theory has been confirmed by many experiments and observations.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Einstein’s intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".
                <br><br>
                ☛ He died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, leaving a legacy of unmatched contributions to the world of science.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="title-section">Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>
                ☛ Albert Einstein was born into a secular Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer, and his mother, Pauline Koch, was a housewife. 
                <br><br>
                ☛ Einstein showed an early interest in science and mathematics. At the age of 16, he wrote his first scientific paper, "The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields."
                <br><br>
                ☛ He pursued his higher education at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, where he studied physics and mathematics. 
                <br><br>
                ☛ After graduating in 1900, he struggled to find a teaching position, eventually taking a job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="title-section">Major Scientific Contributions</h2>
            <p>
                ☛ Einstein's theory of relativity transformed the understanding of space, time, and gravity. The famous equation E=mc², which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy, is a part of this theory.
                <br><br>
                ☛ His explanation of the photoelectric effect provided crucial evidence for the quantum theory, which describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Einstein also made significant contributions to statistical mechanics, the theory of Brownian motion, and the quantum theory of radiation.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="title-section">Later Life and Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                ☛ In 1933, Einstein emigrated to the United States to escape the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany. He accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked for the rest of his career.
                <br><br>
                ☛ During World War II, Einstein's fame made him a prominent figure in the scientific community. He was one of the signatories of a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt urging the development of atomic weapons, which led to the Manhattan Project.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Despite his contributions to the development of atomic energy, Einstein was a lifelong pacifist and advocate for social justice and civil rights.
                <br><br>
                ☛ His legacy continues to influence contemporary physics and science education, and his name remains synonymous with genius and innovation.
